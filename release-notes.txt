Release Notes for Broady - http://developer.berlios.de/projects/broady/

Project Name: Broady
Project Idea: Wolf McCloud
Project Leader: Wolf McCloud
Lead Programmer: Wolf McCloud

In other words, I worked alone on this...

Special thanks to TideUltra, who helped me test this until it worked. Sorry for wasting your time, Tide, now let's play some old LAN-only games. =D


Finally, Broady has been tested and it works.
It might have a few bugs and there is a known memory leak, but it shouldn't cause you any trouble.

NOTE: Win32 users must have WinPcap installed. http://www.winpcap.org/


Q: How do I use it?
A: Pretty simple, when it loads, it displays what it has loaded from the "network.txt" file. If it did not load correctly, close Broady, change the file, and try again.
   To pass this screen, simply press any key.
   Then, you have to select your local adapter (SNIFFING), the one on which you will listen for broadcast packets.
   Then, you have to select the adapter you will be using to communicate with other Broady users (TRANSMITTING). It can be the same as the sniffing adapter.
   That's it, you now just let it run. To quit it, press 'q'. It will go through a clean exit and will log any error.

Q: In my "stderr.txt" file, I see "N_recvfrom failed: 10054". What should I do?
A: This is simply an error saying it was unable to reach the remote computer. You can ignore those.

Q: Where does the name 'Broady' come from?
A: Broady was decided quickly, as most websites for Open Source Software (OSS) ask you to enter a name to your project when you register it. Since I did not pick any, and UDPNet (the name of the first version of Broady) did not seem like a good name, I went for Broady as it sniffs BROADcast packets, hence Broady ('Broad' for Broadcast, and the 'y' to make it sound more human).
